Relative Displacement & Angular Displacement Estimation For Scalable CNC's
a Smart algorithm That can keep track of relative location of bot/router/vehicle by creating a virtual space around it and keeping tract of its relative orentation and locatione.
Practical use-cases: 
- Drone navigation 
- Cnc scalable router
- Warehouse bots
